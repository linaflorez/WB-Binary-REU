## Project: WB-Binary
### Focus: Characterizing a rare dwarf-binary system

#### Process

  > 1. Fit the spectra by performing a Gaussian fitting routine
  > 2. Using the fit, determine the doppler shift for each spectra
  > 3. Run the doppler shift through a Lomb-Scargle 
  
  
  
  Conclusion thus far: _We have identified a stellar companion to a white dwarf featuring emission from atmospheric metals, and have determined the orbital period of the system to be 4.23 hours._ White dwarf, SDSS J114404.74+052951.6, was initially thought to be surrounded by a gas disk caused by an orbiting planetesimal (Guo et al). Through our attempts to confirm this hypothesis, we actually discovered a low mass companion. This is the second confirmed case where the companion body in a white dwarf-brown dwarf system displays atmospheric metals. Studying this type of rare binary allows us to explore more accurate constraints for hot Jupiter models to develop an understanding of the survival of large planets throughout stellar evolution (Casewell et al. 2018).
